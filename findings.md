# EDA Summary

## Findings

- Approximately 10% of customers have churned
- Consumption data is highly skewed and must be treated before modelling
- There are outliers present in the data and these must be treated before modelling
- Price sensitivity has a low correlation with churn
- Feature engineering will be vital, especially if we are to increase the predictive power of price sensitivity
- There is an equal numbers of clients who changed their product after they activated the contract and those who did stayed with the same product from the beginning.
- Churned clients have an antiquity age of 3-6 years.

## Suggestions

-  Competitor price data - perhaps a client is more likely to churn if a competitor has a good offer
available?
- Average Utilities prices across the country - if PowerCoâ€™s prices are way above or below the country
average, will a client be likely to churn?
- Client feedback - a track record of any complaints, calls or feedback provided by the client to
PowerCo might reveal if a client is likely to churn
