# About
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. 
The head of the SME Division is considering a 20% discount to incentivize clients to stay with PowerCo.

# Findings

- Approximately 10% of customers have churned
- Consumption data is highly skewed and must be treated before modelling
- There are outliers present in the data and these must be treated before modelling
- Price sensitivity has a low correlation with churn
- Feature engineering will be vital, especially if we are to increase the predictive power of price sensitivity
- There is an equal numbers of clients who changed their product after they activated the contract and those who did stayed with the same product from the beginning.
- Churned clients have an antiquity age of 3-6 years.
